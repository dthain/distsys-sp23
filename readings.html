<h2>Reading List for Graduate Students</h2>

<p>
The following is a selection of "classic" papers that describe the foundational principles of
distributed systems, along with a selection of more recent systems that make use of these
principles.  Papers marked (REQ) are required readings for all graduate students this semester.
The remainder of the paper are deeper references for concepts discussed in class,
and are strongly suggested for any student that intends to specialize in distributed systems.
</p>

<p>
Graduate students will form reading groups of 2 students which will
meet weekly to digest each paper.  First, each student should read the
paper once individually, and take a few notes according to the rubric
below.  Then, gather with your partner later in the week to discuss the
paper, work out an example, and write up a summary.  Then, work together
to proofread and edit your document so that it is logically sound,
internally consistent, and flows well from one though to the next.
This is an opportunity for you to flex and develop your writing muscles,
which you will need to write technical papers, and eventually your dissertation.
</p>

<p>
A good summary should be two pages of clearly written, well organized text. If the paper presents some opinion or advice (e.g. "A Note on Distributed Computing") then you should summarize the arguments made by the paper in your own words, and offer some reflection on the completeness or applicability of the advice.
</p>
<p>
Most of the other papers will instead be presenting a system or an algorithm.  For those papers,
you should address the following questions:
<ul>
<li> What is the problem that this paper is proposing to solve?
<li> What is the key observation or insight into the problem?
<li> What is the overall structure of the system or algorithmic approach presented as a solution?
<li> How is the solution evaluated, and what are the results?
<li> How does this work relate to concepts discussed in class?
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Summaries are due at 11:59PM on Sundays and should be submitted
as a single PDF document via the "Assignments" tab in Sakai.
Both partners must contribute to the discussion, writing, and editing
of the document, and should be named as authors on the submission.
One student should submit on behalf of the group.  
All authors will receive the same grade.
</p>
